# Report: Binary Classifier for Funding Prediction

## Overview
In this challenge, a binary classifier model leveraging deep learning and neural networks is deployed to predict the likelihood of organizations receiving funding from Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. The dataset, encompassing details on over 34,000 organizations, includes features such as application type, affiliated industry sector, government organization classification, funding use case, income category, requested funding amount, and the effectiveness of fund utilization.

### Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase involves eliminating unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The target variable, determining the success of a charity donation, is IS_SUCCESSFUL.

#### Feature Analysis
- **Target Variable:** IS_SUCCESSFUL
- **Features:** All non-target columns
- **Removed Variable:** EIN (unique identifier)

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
The neural network model is configured with four hidden layers, each utilizing the ReLU activation function. The layers consist of 80, 30, 20, and 10 neurons, respectively. This configuration was chosen based on iterative testing, with the final optimization achieving an accuracy of 78.4%.

#### Model Performance
- **Neurons:** 80, 30, 20, 10
- **Activation Function:** ReLU
- **Accuracy:** 78.4%

#### Optimization Steps
1. Adjusted cutoff points for APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION features.
2. Altered the number of nodes and layers.
3. Included the NAME feature, resulting in a final accuracy of 78.4%.

### Summary
The deep learning model, developed using the TensorFlow library with Keras, achieved an accuracy of 78.4%. While effective, it's worth noting that a Random Forest Classifier could provide a competitive alternative, potentially requiring less optimization and mitigating the risk of overfitting.
