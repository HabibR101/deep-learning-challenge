# Deep Learning Challenge: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a binary classifier capable of predicting the success of applicants seeking nonprofit funding from the Alphabet Soup foundation.

## Repository Contents
The repository includes Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for an initial model and three optimization models. Additionally, model weights are saved in both .h5/.hdf5 formats. The models are organized into folders corresponding to each specific optimization model.

## Task
The primary task is to enhance the accuracy of the classifier to surpass 75%. The provided models serve as a starting point, and improvements are sought through iterative optimization.

## Report
A comprehensive report, documented in Markdown format, is included. The file named Report.md contains detailed insights, analysis, and observations related to the development and performance of the models. This report serves as a valuable resource for understanding the decisions made during the development process.

## Approach
To achieve the accuracy goal, various strategies such as data preprocessing, model architecture adjustments, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization algorithm exploration have been implemented. The model weights saved at regular intervals provide a snapshot of the training progress.

## Conclusion
The ultimate aim is to create a highly accurate binary classifier that can effectively predict the success of nonprofit funding applicants. The provided materials and report offer a comprehensive overview of the development process and the rationale behind the decisions made to enhance model performance.
